# **PopChoice** 

**Your friendly AI-powered movie recommender**

PopChoice helps you find your next favorite movie through natural conversation. Just type something like:

## **📌 Project Description**

PopChoice is an AI-powered movie recommendation app built as part of the **Scrimba - The AI Engineer Path** course. It combines modern frontend development with AI-driven search and recommendation logic.

Users can simply enter their movie preferences in plain English, and PopChoice uses a combination of **OpenAI’s chat completions**, **embeddings**, and **vector similarity search** (via Supabase) to deliver relevant movie suggestions.
